# Data-Structures
A brief comparison between 3 most used type of data structures

The .png file represents one test and it shows 3 different characteristics of data:
- Creation: via timeit function 
- Size: via the sys.getsizeof() function, in bytes
- Insertion: via scripted functions 

It would be nice to improve it with more data structures, and try and find new faster solutions for data insertion. If you were wondering what method is faster,
thanks to this small script you could actually see it in real time.
